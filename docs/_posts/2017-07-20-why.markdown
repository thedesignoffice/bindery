## Why

TKTK Print as an extension of the responsive web, relating presentation to content, CSS regions, history

## Background

Bindery.js 1.x was written in Spring 2014 for [for/with/in](http://htmloutput.risd.gd/),
a publication from participants in the graphic design course "HTML Output" at RISD. It was based on the [now-abandoned](https://alistapart.com/blog/post/css-regions-considered-harmful) CSS Regions spec, using [a polyfill ](https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-regions-polyfill). [Catherine Leigh Schmidt](http://cath.land) and [Lukas WinklerPrins](http://ltwp.net) produced a Jekyll theme called [Baby Bindery](https://github.com/thedesignoffice/babybindery) for the [Design Office](http://thedesignoffice.org/) based on this initial version.

Bindery.js 2.x is a complete rewrite, developed since February 2017 by [Evan Brooks](http://evanbrooks.info). With thanks to [John Caserta](http://johncaserta.com/) for feedback.
