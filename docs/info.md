### Print to Web to Print

Computer printers predate computer screens.

### Bindery is not trying to be...

1. InDesign — Bindery is for people who are interested in creating layouts
programmatically. It's not a graphical user interface (though you could build one around it).
2. A PDF generator — Bindery assumes you're printing straight from
  the browser. If you want to adjust a PDF setting, your browser must support it—for
  example, you must use a page size provided by your browser's print dialog.
3. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) — Bindery is intended to let everyone who knows web standards (or is learning)
  to design books. It takes advantage of all the existing tools and documentation—browsers, text editor, web inspectors,
  etc. LaTeX is its own layout system and language for technical users.



### Background

Bindery.js 1.x was developed in Spring 2014 for [for/with/in](http://htmloutput.risd.gd/),
a publication from participants in the graphic design course "HTML Output" at RISD. It was based on the [much-maligned](https://alistapart.com/blog/post/css-regions-considered-harmful), [now abandoned](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/google-plans-to-dump-adobe-css-tech-to-make-blink-fast-not-rich/) CSS Regions spec, using [a polyfill ](https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-regions-polyfill). [Catherine Leigh Schmidt](http://cath.land) and [Lukas WinklerPrins](http://ltwp.net) produced a Jekyll theme called [Baby Bindery](https://github.com/thedesignoffice/babybindery) for the [Design Office](http://thedesignoffice.org/) based on this initial version.

Bindery.js 2.x is a complete rewrite, developed since February 2017 by [Evan Brooks](http://evanbrooks.info). With thanks to [John Caserta](http://johncaserta.com/) and [Teddy Bradford](#) for contributions and feedback.
